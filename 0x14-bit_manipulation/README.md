Project:
0x14. C - Bit manipulation

TASK:
0.  Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int

1. Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
